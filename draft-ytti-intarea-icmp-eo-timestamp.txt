1.  Introduction

   IP devices use the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv4
   [RFC0792] and ICMPv6 [RFC4443]) to convey control information.  In
   particular, when an IP device receives a datagram that it cannot
   process, it may send an ICMP message to the datagram's originator.
   Network operators and high-level protocols use these ICMP messages to
   detect and diagnose network issues.

   One typical application for ICMP messages is for a network operator
   to intentionally send packet which IP device is unable to process, so
   that the network operator may learn diagnostic information about the
   IP device.  Information network operator can recover with this method
   includes for example IP devices in path between source and
   destination as well as RTT or round-trip time between originator and
   the IP device in the path.

   RTT information can be used to reduce the time it takes to diagnose
   and solve a network problem.  RTT does not however communicate if the
   issue seen is from source to destination or from destination to
   source, this means that network operator needs to communicate to
   networks operating both direction in effort to diagnose the network
   problem.

   Using the extension defined herein, a device can explicitly
   communicate its timestamp in the ICMP message allowing the receiver
   of the message to calculate unidirectional delay times.  Using this
   information operator can reduce the time it takes to diagnose and

   solve the network problem by being able to determine if the observed
   issue occurs in forward or reverse path.

2.  Applications

   ICMP extension defined in this memo provides additional capability to
   traceroute.  An enhanced traceroute application, like older
   implementations, identifies nodes that a datagram visited en route to
   its destination.  It differs from older implementation in that it can
   determine unidirectional latencies of nodes in the path.

3.  Timestamp Object

   This section defines the Timestamp Object, an ICMP extension object
   with a Class-Num (Object Class Value) of FIXME4 that can be appended
   to the following messages:

      ICMPv4 Time Exceeded
      ICMPv4 Destination Unreachable
      ICMPv4 Parameter Problem
      ICMPv6 Time Exceeded
      ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable

   For reasons described in [RFC4884], this extension cannot be appended
   to any of the currently defined ICMPv4 or ICMPv6 messages other than
   the listed above.

   The extension defiend herein MAY be appended to any of the above
   listed messages and SHOULD be appended whenever local policy or
   security considerations do not supersede this requirement.

   A single ICMP message can contain zero or one instances of the
   Timestamp Object.

4.  C-Type Meaning in an Timestamp Object

   When the C-Type [RFC4884] subtype is set to zero, the object payload
   indicates the earliest time host is able to measure of the embedded
   triggering packet arriving and the latest time host is able to
   measure of the ICMP message departing.  This is illustrated in Fugure
   1.

                Figure 1: C-Type 0 for the Timestamp Object

   48 bit Arriving Timestamp:  Earliest possible timestamp of the
      embedded triggering packet arriving at the host.
   48 bit Departing Timestamp:  Latest possible timestamp of the ICMP
      message departing from the host.

5.  Timestamp

   The timestamp MUST be 6 bytes or 48 bits wide, most significant bit
   is a flag called NCE or 'non-canonical epoch'.  If the NCE flag is
   not set the timestamp's epoch is UTC midnight.  If the NCE flag is
   set the timestamp's epoch is unspecified but not UTC midnight.
   Timestamp unit is nanoseconds.
